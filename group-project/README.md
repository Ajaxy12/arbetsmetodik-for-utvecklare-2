## 📋 Project Overview

This is the group assignment for **Arbetsmetodik för utvecklare 2**. We are building a webshop mockup using agile methodologies (Scrum/Kanban).

**Focus:** The agile process is more important than the design itself.

### 🔄 Agile Methodologies

**Scrum** is a framework/methodology (not a tool) for managing complex work through iterative sprints.

#### Major Components:
- **Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers
- **Events:** Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
- **Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
- **Time-boxed sprints:** Typically 1-4 weeks with fixed start/end dates
- **Regular inspection and adaptation:** Review and adjust after each sprint

#### When to Use Scrum:

**For Groups:**
- ✅ When you have a team (3-9 people recommended)
- ✅ When you need structured planning and regular check-ins
- ✅ When work can be organized into fixed time periods (sprints)
- ✅ When you need clear roles and responsibilities
- ✅ When you want regular demos and feedback cycles
- ✅ For complex projects requiring coordination

**For Solo Work:**
- ✅ When you want structure and discipline in your workflow
- ✅ When you have deadlines and need time-boxed work periods
- ✅ When you want to practice Scrum methodology
- ✅ When you need regular self-reflection and planning
- ⚠️ Less ideal for solo work (designed for teams)

---

**Kanban** is a visual workflow management method (not a tool) using a board with columns.

#### Major Components:
- **Visual board:** Columns like Backlog, Doing, Test, Done
- **Work items:** Move through columns as they progress
- **Continuous flow:** No fixed time periods (unlike sprints)
- **Work in Progress (WIP) limits:** Control how much work is active at once
- **Transparency:** See all work and identify bottlenecks easily
- **Flexibility:** Add/remove items anytime, no sprint boundaries

#### When to Use Kanban:

**For Groups:**
- ✅ When you need flexibility and continuous delivery
- ✅ When work items vary in size and duration
- ✅ When you want to visualize workflow and bottlenecks
- ✅ When you need to prioritize and reprioritize frequently
- ✅ For support/maintenance work with unpredictable tasks
- ✅ When team members work on different timelines

**For Solo Work:**
- ✅ Excellent for personal projects and task management
- ✅ When you want simple, visual organization
- ✅ When you have varying task sizes and priorities
- ✅ When you need flexibility without fixed deadlines
- ✅ For ongoing work without clear sprint boundaries
- ✅ Perfect for managing multiple projects simultaneously

#### Quick Comparison:

| Aspect | Scrum | Kanban |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Time Structure** | Fixed sprints (1-4 weeks) | Continuous flow |
| **Planning** | Sprint planning meetings | On-demand planning |
| **Best For Groups** | ✅ Structured teams | ✅ Flexible workflows |
| **Best For Solo** | ⚠️ Can work but less ideal | ✅ Excellent fit |
| **Complexity** | More structured | Simpler, more flexible |
| **Commitments** | Sprint goals and commitments | No fixed commitments |
| **Meetings** | Regular ceremonies required | Minimal meetings needed |

**In This Project:** We're using a hybrid approach - Scrum's sprint structure with Kanban's visual board (markdown files) for flexibility.
